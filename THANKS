PRAISE AND BLAME
================

The following people have contributed directly to the continued existence of these scripts:

   *Cass Alexandru*  
   *Markus Klinik"
   *Camil Staps*  
   *Mart Lubbers*  
   *Thom Wiggers*  
   *Daan Sprenkels*
   *Etienne Bruines*  
   *Lars Jellema*  
   *Jip Dekker*  
   *Steven Reitsma*  
   *Pol Van Aubel*  
   *Joost Rijneveld*  
   *Ward Theunisse*
   *Marc Schoolderman*

Special blame should be directed at Ruben Nijveld and Marlon Baeten for suggesting the weird challenge-response Javascript-system BlackBoard used (back then) could be circumvented by using wget in a bash script. They were probably not being serious.
